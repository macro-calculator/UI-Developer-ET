        <h1>MEET OUR TEAM</h1>
        <p>
        Team Macrolator is made up of several developers and clients have the opportubity of working with each team members individually per submission request.
        Team Macrolator isnt just about us but rather about our team of CLIENTS!
        We offer flexible dieting protocols that coincide with low cardio and the highest calories possible that we can get someone to their best shape ever with.
         No more eating chicken and veggies over and over, if someone wants to diet on pancakes and eggs, it’s fine. If they want to eat a homemade burger and fries on a white bun, it’s fine- if it all fits into your macros for that meal. 
         We diet a lot of people letting them pick their food choices and it’s been shown over the years that it will NOT get in the way of fat loss. And, no more doing 2 hours or more of cardio a day 7 days a week, a majority of our clients not even doing steady state cardio but instead a few HIIT sessions a week. 
        They hold onto muscle better this way, with a majority hitting new PR’s in the gym all the way into the final weeks of prep.
