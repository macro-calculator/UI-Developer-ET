             <h2>WHAT ARE MACROS?</h2>
               <p>Each of the foods we eat are made up of three “macros” (macronutrients).
                    These macros being carbohydrates (carbs), proteins, and fat.
                     Chicken is high in the protein macro but has no carbs. 
                     Rice is high in carbs, but very little fat or protein.
                     Macro counting is extremely successful, and can free you from the “good food, bad food” mindset.
                     You don’t need to make radical shifts in your diet, nor deprive yourself of your favorite foods.
                      Just make sure you are within your macro counts for each day, and you’re set to go!
                </p>

                        Carbohydrates(both types) are the sugars,starches and fibers found in fruits,grains,vegetables and milk products. 
                        Though often maligned in trendy diets, carbohydrates are one of the basic food groups that are important to a healthy diet.

                            Protein is in every cell in the body. Our bodies need protein from the foods we eat to build and maintain bones, muscles and skin.
                             We get proteins in our diet from meat, dairy products, nuts, and certain grains and beans.

                        Fat is a type of nutrient. You need some fat in your diet but not too much.
                         Fats give you energy and help your body absorb vitamins. Dietary fat also plays a major role in your cholesterol levels.
                         But not all fats are the same.

                  <h2>HEALTHIER LIFESTYLE TIPS!</h2>
                    <p>For good health, we need more than 40 different nutrients, and no single food can supply them all. 
                        It is not about a single meal, it is about a balanced food choice over time that will make a difference!</p>
                    <li>About half the calories in our diet should come from foods rich in carbohydrates, such as cereals, rice, pasta, potatoes, and bread. It is a good idea to include at least one of these at every meal. 
                        Wholegrain foods, like wholegrain bread, pasta, and cereals, will increase our fibre intake.</li>
                    <li>Fruits and vegetables are among the most important foods for giving us enough vitamins, minerals and fibre. We should try to eat at least 5 servings a day. </li>
                    <li>Sugar provides sweetness and an attractive taste, but sugary foods and drinks are rich in energy, and are best enjoyed in moderation, as an occasional treat. We could use fruits instead, even to sweeten our foods and drinks.</li>
                    <li>Paying attention to portion size will help us not to consume too much calories, and will allow us to eat all the foods we enjoy, without having to eliminate any.</li>
                    <li>Physical activity is important for people of all weight ranges and health conditions.
                         It helps us burn off the extra calories, it is good for the heart and circulatory system, it maintains or increases our muscle mass, it helps us focus, and improves overall health well-being.</li>

                    <p>This calculator is designed by flexible dieters. IIFYM is another name for flexible dieting. The full form of IIFYM is if it fits your macros.
                         Macros are short for macro nutrients, and they are defined as substrates used to produce energy in the body. Carbohydrates, fats, and proteins are the macro nutrients. 
                        The caloric total for food is calculated by adding all the macro nutrient amount together.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class ="drake">
                     <p>The Macro Calculator calculates your TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure), then uses that to set the amount of calories you will be consuming while following the IIFYM diet for fat loss.
                        In order to lose weight (burn fat) you need to consume less calories than your body needs.
                         A calorie deficit of 15-20% off of your TDEE is used as a safe caloric deficit to shoot for to insure fast fat loss without burning up your lean muscle mass.

                               <p>Lose puts you in a 20% calorie deficit which promotes safe, steady weight loss.
                                    Lose 10% puts you in a 10% calorie deficit and is intended for those with less than 10 pounds to lose and who also wish to build muscle at the same time.
                                    Maintain allows you to eat at macro levels that will keep you at your current weight.
                                    Gain puts you in a 20% calorie surplus and is designed for people who are wanting to build muscle fast in conjunction with a comprehensive weight training program.
                                     It can also be used by people who are underweight.</p>
